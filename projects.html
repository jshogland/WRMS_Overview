                    Raster Tools is a python package that facilitates a wide range of spatial, statistical, machine learning analyses using delayed and automated parallel processing. Our library focuses on significantly reducing processing time and storage space associated with analyzing large spatial datasets while also introducing new spatial, statistical, machine learning concepts into an easy-to-use python based API.

                    SSMART Forestry is committed to advancing sustainable forestry practices and pioneering innovative solutions 
                    for the industry. We harness the power of smart technology and science-based approaches to enhance the resilience of Oregon's 
                    forests and the well-being of forest-dependent rural communities.

                    Fire Resilient Landscapes highlights using Jupyter notebooks to perform 21 century fuels 
                    planning that incorporate the PODs concept into forest management planning.
                    As part of the project we demonstrate how Raster Tools and ancillary data 
                    can be used to identify and quantify treatment locations and cost of 
                    implementation to reduce fire risk and create fire resilient landscapes. 
                    Project Jupyter notebooks can be used as templates for other landscapes.

                        Fireline Effectiveness Analysis

                    Wildland fire response is resource-intensive, high-risk, and increasingly complex. To improve outcomes, 
                    we need a better understanding of what has worked â€” and why. The Human Dimensions 
                    WRMS team work helps meet this need by analyzing where firelines successfully held, burned over, 
                    or were not engaged across hundreds of large wildfires. This evidence-based approach provides the 
                    Forest Service with actionable insights to improve strategic planning, firefighter safety, and real-time decision-making.
