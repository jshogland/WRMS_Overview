                    Dr. John Hogland is a Research Forester working for the Rocky Mountain Research Station. 
                    His research interests revolve around quantitative methods within geographic information systems (GIS) and understanding the relationships between 
                    landscape patterns and forested ecosystems processes. Current projects include: 1) quantifying forest characteristics at fine spatial scales, 2) 
                    designing, developing, and building new procedures that integrate machine learning and statistical modeling with fast raster processing (Function Modeling) 
                    to streamline spatial modeling and reduce storage space associated wit
                    h GIS analyses, and 3) developing sampling strategies focused on reducing the cost of 
                    sampling while maintaining the characteristics of a representative sample.

                    Alexander P. Arkowitz is a Geospatial Wildfire Analytics Research Associate with Colorado State University and a contractor for the 
                    US Forest Service â€“ Rocky Mountain Research Station. He leads research on wildfire containment and suppression effectiveness, developing 
                    spatial models to evaluate fireline engagement, fuel treatment performance, and operational strategies. With over a decade of experience 
                    in wildfire science, emergency response, and geospatial analysis, Alex has contributed to national fireline datasets, incident mapping, 
                    and situational awareness tools for agencies including the USFS, BLM, and NOAA. He holds an M.S. in Applied Geospatial Sciences from 
                    Northern Arizona University and is FAA-certified as a remote pilot.
